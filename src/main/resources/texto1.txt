1. The Original: Neapolitan
This is the original pizza that left Italy and arrived with Italian immigrants in the United States.  This is the pizza that launched American pizza fanaticism.  In fact, Italy has sought UNESCO heritage protection for the Neapolitan pizza .  The dough is made from Tipo 00 wheat flour and the crust is thin, crunchy, and baked in a wood-fired oven.  The pizza  should have minimal toppings --- perhaps San Marzano tomato sauce, bufala mozzarella cheese, and basil --- because too much sauce or cheese will weigh down the crust and make it soggy.
