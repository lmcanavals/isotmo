4. Chicago Thin Crust
The Chicago thin crust is crispier and crunchier than the New York style and normally cut into squares (or tavern cut) rather than diagonal slices.

The Quad City area, a group of five cities between Iowa and Illinois, has developed a variation of the Chicago thin crust which uses a spicy sauce, large amounts of meat, and is cut into strips or squares.
