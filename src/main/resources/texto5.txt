5. Detroit Style
The Detroit style pizza  is a square pizza, similar to Sicilian-style pizza, with a deep-dish crust and marinara sauce sometimes served on top.  The crust is usually baked in a well-oiled pan to develop caramelized crunchy edges.  Detroit style pizza has developed a larger fan base as Detroit-based Little Caesars launched a Detroit-style deep dish pizza available at its nationwide chains.
